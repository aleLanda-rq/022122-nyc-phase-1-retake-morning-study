# Phase 1 Retake Daily Challenges

To get started, clone down the repo and open it in vscode. You'll notice that there is a folder for each 'day' (if you're on day 1, there's only one).

Open the index.html in that day's folder and it'll include instructions for you to follow.

Each of these study challenges should take about 30 minutes. You can work alone or in groups, up to you! I'll release a solution branch each day. Once you've finished a challenge, you can erase it with `git stash` or save it in a new branch (`git checkout -b day-1 && git add . && git commit -m "day 1" && git checkout main`) before cloning down the challenge for the next day.

Good luck!
