# Phase 1 Retake Daily Challenges

To get started, clone down the repo and open it in vscode. You'll notice that there is a folder for each 'day' (if you're on day 1, there's only one).

Open the index.html in that day's folder and it'll include instructions for you to follow.

Each of these study challenges should take about 30 minutes.

Good luck!
